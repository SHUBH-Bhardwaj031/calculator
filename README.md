# 🧮 Command-Line Calculator in Python

This is a simple and interactive **command-line calculator** built using Python.  
It supports basic arithmetic operations like:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

It runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit, and uses **separate functions** for each operation to keep the code clean and modular.

## 🧱 How It Works

1. Shows a menu with 5 choices:
   - Add
   - Subtract
   - Multiply
   - Divide
   - Exit
2. Takes two numbers as input using `input()`
3. Performs the operation using a function (`add()`, `subtract()`, etc.)
4. Displays the result
5. Repeats until user selects Exit
